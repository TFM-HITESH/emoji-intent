## Rules

1. Only select from the controlled vocabulary. Never invent new keywords.
2. Each message must have **1‚Äì5 keywords** that best describe its intent, emotional tone, or risk.
3. Choose both **structural intent** and **emotional tone** whenever possible.
4. If the message contains harmful or risky content, always include the appropriate toxicity keyword(s).
5. If the message is neutral, still tag structural intent (e.g., acknowledgement, casual).
6. Always preserve the `id` and `author` from the input.
